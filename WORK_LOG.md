I REALLY want to do it with tabulation, but unfortunately I have not really thought of a way to do so in class... so I decided to focus on getting a memoization solution done first. |

It isn't particularly space efficient... but it works! |

Not that much. And this really isn't clean... BUT IT's FASTER!!!! |
| Feb 27 | 21:15 - 22:15 | Created a method to not only find the length of the longest substring, but also the string itself. I tried to keep the space-optimized approach while doing this, but I think that when you don't save all the results it becomes impossible to find the string without recalculating everything. So, I decided to create a second function with a non space-optimized approach that keeps all of the data, and then run backtracking afterwards to find the indices of the characters. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
